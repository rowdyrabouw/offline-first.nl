			<h1>Jurassic World: Dominion</h1>

			<h2>Plot Synopsis</h2>
			<p>
				Four years after the cataclysmic volcanic eruption on Isla Nublar and
				the Lockwood Estate incident, de-extinct dinosaurs freely roam the
				earth. Claire Dearing, former operations manager of Jurassic World,
				works for the Dinosaur Protection Group. She and Owen Grady live in a
				remote cabin in the Sierra Nevada mountains, secretly caring for Maisie
				Lockwood, Benjamin Lockwood's cloned granddaughter. Owen's trained
				Velociraptor, Blue, unexpectedly arrives with an asexually reproduced
				offspring which Maisie names Beta.
			</p>
			<p>
				Biosyn Genetics conducts genomics research on dinosaurs, ostensibly
				seeking cures for diseases and agronomic applications. Unbeknownst to
				Claire and Owen, Biosyn wants to study Maisie's DNA for nefarious
				agendas. When Maisie, frustrated with living in seclusion, sneaks away,
				Biosyn operatives kidnap her and Beta. Elsewhere, swarms of formerly
				extinct giant locusts have inexplicably reappeared, threatening the
				global food supply. Paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler observes that crops
				grown with Biosyn seed are left uneaten, leading her to suspect that
				Biosyn created the locusts. Believing the locust's DNA dates to the
				Cretaceous period, Ellie approaches former partner and paleontologist
				Dr. Alan Grant, who agrees to help investigate Biosyn.
			</p>
			<p>
				With help from CIA contacts, Claire and Owen track Maisie and Beta to
				Malta, where they infiltrate a dinosaur black market. When authorities
				raid the market, dinosaurs are unintentionally released, causing havoc.
				A Biosyn employee informs Claire and Owen that Maisie and Beta are being
				transported to Biosyn's secluded headquarters and dinosaur valley in
				Italy's Dolomites mountain range. Kayla Watts, a sympathetic cargo
				pilot, offers to fly Owen and Claire there.
			</p>
			<p>
				Chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm, now working for Biosyn, invites Alan and
				Ellie to the headquarters to help him uncover CEO Lewis Dodgson's
				illegal activities. Aiding Ian is communications director Ramsay Cole.
				It is revealed that geneticist Dr. Henry Wu genetically engineered the
				locusts to only consume rival companies' crops so that Biosyn can
				dominate the agricultural market. Wu meets Maisie and explains that she
				is not a clone. Instead, Charlotte Lockwood, Benjamin Lockwood's
				daughter and Wu's former colleague, used her own DNA to create Maisie as
				her child. Charlotte died from a genetic disorder, but she had altered
				Maisie's DNA to make her immune. Wu believes that Maisie's and Beta's
				DNA are key to creating a pathogen to halt the locust outbreak.
			</p>
			<p>
				Upon reaching Biosyn airspace, a group of Quetzalcoatlus attack Kayla's
				cargo plane. Claire ejects while Owen and Kayla survive a crash landing.
				Following separate encounters with a Therizinosaurus and a Pyroraptor,
				the three regroup. Inside the Biosyn facility, Ian and Ramsey provide
				Ellie and Alan access to a restricted lab where they steal a locust
				sample and encounter Maisie. After discovering the locust lab was
				breached, Dodgson ignites it to destroy all evidence, inadvertently
				starting a forest fire. He also ends Ian's employment for exposing his
				operation. Alan, Ellie, and Maisie find Ian, and they then meet up with
				Owen, Claire, and Kayla. Meanwhile, Dodgson attempts to escape with
				dinosaur embryos via a hyperloop; when the power fails, he becomes
				trapped and subsequently killed by three Dilophosaurus. Electronic
				devices call the dinosaurs to the Biosyn headquarters to protect them
				from the fire, while Owen captures Beta.
			</p>
			<p>
				A Giganotosaurus terrorizes the group until the Therizinosaurus and the
				Tyrannosaurus rex kill it. The group escapes via helicopter, taking Wu,
				who claims he can eradicate the locusts, with them. Back on the
				mainland, Wu releases a locust carrying the pathogen he discovered,
				successfully wiping out the locusts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ellie and Alan renew their romantic relationship before joining Ian and
				Ramsay to testify against Biosyn. Owen, Claire, and Maisie return home
				and reunite Beta and Blue. Around the world, dinosaurs adapt to co-exist
				with modern animals while the United Nations declares Biosyn Valley a
				dinosaur sanctuary.
