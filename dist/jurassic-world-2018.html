			<h1>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</h1>
			<img src="assets/img/jurassic-world-2018.jpg" alt="" />
			<h2>Plot Synopsis</h2>
			<p>
				Six months after the demise of the Jurassic World theme park on Isla
				Nublar, a group of mercenaries are sent to Isla Nublar to recover the
				bones of the Indominus Rex from the Jurassic World lagoon for the
				creation of a new genetically modified hybrid: the Indoraptor. A
				submersible is sent down to retrieve the bones, and it sends them up on
				a buoy before it is attacked by the Mosasaurus. The people on land who
				opened the gate to the lagoon lose contact with the submarine pilots.
				The gate starts to close and a Dilophosaurus can be heard running away
				in the jungle. The trees nearby shake and Jurassic World's veteran
				Tyrannosaurus Rex attacks the group. Jack is left on the ground and
				their helicopter lets down a rope ladder. They escape the Tyrannosaurus,
				but Jack is then swallowed by the Mosasaurus after it jumps into the air
				and it escapes from its enclosure.
			</p>
			<p>
				It then cuts to the mainland, in the year 2018, where Claire Dearing,
				the former park manager, has now founded the Dinosaur Protection Group,
				an organization dedicated to saving and protecting the dinosaurs. After
				the government refuses to fund a rescue operation to save the dinosaurs,
				alongside Ian Malcolm, Claire meets Benjamin Lockwood, an old business
				partner of John Hammond, who agrees to fund the rescue mission and bring
				the dinosaurs to a new sanctuary island where they will be left to live
				on their own, safe from human interference. Lockwood's assistant, Eli
				Mills, asks Claire to recruit Owen Grady, a former raptor trainer who
				worked at the park, to find and capture Blue, the last surviving
				Velociraptor. Claire recruits Owen to help her rescue the remaining
				dinosaurs from the island.
			</p>
			<p>
				Claire and Owen then set off on a charter plane with Zia Rodriguez, a
				paleo-veterinarian, and Franklin Webb, an IT expert, both from the
				Dinosaur Protection Group. Once their plane lands, the group is
				surprised to find a large base camp has already been set up, and they
				are met by Ken Wheatley, a big game and trophy hunter. They all set off
				along with a group of mercenaries to reactivate an abandoned radio
				communications tower that they will use to find the dinosaurs via their
				RFID chip implants. Along the way while passing through the Jurassic
				World main street, they encounter a Brachiosaurus.
			</p>
			<p>
				Owen, Zia, Wheatley and some of the mercenaries go to find Blue. Owen
				suggests that he set out on his own to find Blue, and the others stay
				behind at the truck. When Owen comes upon the fallen Explorer 04 near
				the old Tyrannosaur Paddock from the first Jurassic Park, Blue jumps out
				and Owen tries to bond with her before she is tranquilized by Wheatley
				and his mercenaries. Angry, Blue tackles a mercenary and kills him but
				not before drawing his sidearm and shooting her, much to Wheatley's and
				Owen's dismay. Owen tries to attack Wheatley but Wheatley tranquilizes
				him and threatens to shoot Zia. Zia says that she is the only one who
				can keep Blue alive and Wheatley has his men put their weapons down.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mt. Sibo erupts, causing the mercenaries protecting Claire and Franklin
				to panic and drive off, locking them inside the old communications
				center. A Baryonyx surprises them by crawling through an old tunnel, but
				is temporarily held at bay by falling lava. Franklin and Claire narrowly
				escape through an emergency ladder and lock the Baryonyx inside the
				communications center. Owen awakes from his unconsciousness, but is
				still mostly immobile. He is surprised by a Sinoceratops, which plays
				with him for a little while before getting scared off and running away
				from the approaching lava which crawls toward Owen but he manages to
				(barely) escape just before he is engulfed by the lava. He runs into
				Claire and Franklin and yells at them repeatedly to "Run", the three
				elude the lava and falling debris and magma bombs, while avoiding
				getting trampled by the stampeding dinosaurs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Franklin and Claire both hide inside a Gyrosphere, when a Carnotaurus
				appears and fights a Sinoceratops, before being pinned down and killed
				by the T. Rex who also makes a run for it. Franklin, Claire, and Owen
				make a run from the burning ash, Owen is slowed down a bit by the ash,
				but Claire and Franklin fall off the edge with several other dinosaurs.
				The magma bombs break the Gyrosphere, and Claire and Franklin almost
				drown, but are able to survive when Owen opens one of the doors using
				his survival knife. Crawling up on the beach, they see several of the
				dinosaurs, such as the Baryonyx and T. Rex all being captured, The
				mercenaries on the ship called the Arcadia begin caging all of the
				captured dinosaurs, Wheatley takes a pair of pliers and yanks a tooth
				out of a tranquilized Stegosaurus, Owen, Claire, and Franklin also see
				Blue being tended to by Zia who has been captured,then the three use a
				truck to drive on the ship, which is leaving the island, they only
				barely make it, and watch the island burn up in the background. A
				trapped Brachiosaurus calls out to the departing ship before being
				engulfed by the ash and perishing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Eli is disappointed by the lack of progress, and meets with Gunnar
				Eversol, an auctioneer who plans to sell the dinosaurs with for money.
				Lockwood's apparent granddaughter Maisie overhears their conversation
				and learns of their plan. Eli takes Gunnar to a lab, where he reveals
				that they are creating a new dinosaur with Indominus Rex, mourn
				Smurfette, and Velociraptor called the Indoraptor, and potentially other
				improvements in its wake for the sake of military interests and warfare.
				With the current one being a prototype, and their plan to use it for
				militaristic purposes. Maisie attempts to tell Benjamin, but he
				seemingly believes she misheard them and sends her off to bed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Owen, Claire, and Franklin meet up with Zia, who believes they need Blue
				for something; Zia further tells them that before she can treat Blue's
				gunshot wound, she needs a ready blood transfusion for Blue just in
				case. Unfortunately (much to Claire's charging), the only blood match on
				the ship would belong to a tranquilized T. Rex on board and inside one
				of the transport trucks, and so Zia sends both Owen and Claire to
				retrieve some of the live dinosaur's blood. They find the Tyrannosaur
				and successfully get her blood but are locked in by some of the guards
				as the T. Rex wakes up. As the agitated animal begins to freak out and
				thrash violently, Claire escapes through the top and opens the main
				doors of the cage; Owen narrowly escapes the T. Rex's snapping jaws
				before she can bite him in half. The crew gives the blood to Blue before
				they make a dash; unfortunately, Franklin is caught and mistaken for a
				mercenary, and is forced to help transfer the dinosaurs to Lockwood
				Manor. Owen and Claire sneak into a truck, but are discovered by
				Wheatley and imprisoned in the basement of Lockwood Manor.
			</p>
			<p>
				Maisie, having observed Mills entering the entrance code for the
				mansion's elevator the previous day, secretly enters the laboratory and
				watches several clips of Owen training the Velociraptors on Isla Nublar.
				Her exploration is interrupted by Mills and Dr. Henry Wu; the latter is
				extremely stressed about Blue's condition. Maisie, in an attempt to
				escape the two men, backs into a corridor and encounters the caged
				Indoraptor, who reaches out and gently strokes her hair from behind.
				Maisie screams, alerting the attention of Mills, who angrily escorts her
				upstairs and locks her in her bedroom.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lockwood confronts Mills about the latter's true intention of selling
				the dinosaurs in an auction, angered that Mills has crossed him and used
				his own mansion as the auction's venue. Ordered by Lockwood to call the
				police himself, Mills instead murders Lockwood by smothering him with a
				pillow.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bidders soon arrive for a dinosaur auction and place their bids on
				various species of dinosaurs captured by the team on the island,
				including an Ankylosaurus, a juvenile Allosaurus, a Baryonyx, and
				multiple others. After being captured by Wheatley, Owen attracts the
				attention of a Stygimoloch, causing her to break through the wall and
				eventually break through the doors of Owen and Claire's cell allowing
				them to escape. Meanwhile in the auction room of Lockwood's estate,
				Eversol and Mills show the crowd the prototype Indoraptor, emphasizing
				that the animal is not for sale. Amazed by the creature's ability to
				lock onto a specific target (courtesy of a laser and an acoustic signal
				on a gun), the attendees begin to bid on the Indoraptor. Eversol is
				coaxed by Mills to accept bids, much to Wu's disdain as the prototype
				Indoraptor lacks Blue's genome - and thus can neither empathize nor
				follow more specific orders.
			</p>
			<p>
				Owen and Claire encounter Maisie, who has escaped her room and
				discovered her dead grandfather, and the three enter the auction room as
				the Indoraptor is being displayed. Understanding that the Indoraptor is
				far too dangerous to be sold, Owen disrupts the auction's proceedings
				with the aid of the Stygimoloch and wreaks havoc among the spectators,
				causing Mills and Eversol to end the auction. Owen bests several
				mercenaries in hand-to-hand combat, then reverses a switch which
				prevents the Indoraptor's cage from exiting the auction room.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later in the evening, Wheatley enters the deserted auction room and
				notices the Indoraptor. Having never seen the creature before and
				wanting one of its teeth for his necklace, Wheatley shoots the
				Indoraptor with two tranquilizer darts and enters the cage after the
				Indoraptor appears to be sedated. In reality, the Indoraptor is
				unaffected by the tranquilizer darts; he smiles and distracts Wheatley
				by waving his tail in the air before severing Wheatley's right arm and
				devouring him, his death is witnessed by Eversol who makes a dash for
				the elevator (without being spotted by the hybrid), where all the other
				executives were hiding, but pushes a woman out of the way so he can
				access the code to close the elevator, causing her to scream at the
				sight of the Indoraptor, who rushes at the still open elevator but the
				doors successfully close before the Indoraptor can reach them; however,
				the hybrid (either with intent or by chance) uses its tail to cut off
				the power supply to the auction room, which automatically reopens the
				elevator door. The Indoraptor then proceeds to maul Eversol and the
				other executives to death.
			</p>
			<p>
				Owen reunites with Claire and Maisie and the three encounter Mills and
				two security guards in the mansion's basement. After unsuccessfully
				trying to coax Maisie to come with him, Mills angrily and cruelly
				reveals that Maisie is actually a clone of Lockwood's beloved daughter
				who had perished in a car accident many years prior. As Owen, Claire and
				Maisie process this revelation, the Indoraptor suddenly appears and
				kills the two security guards, prompting the others to flee.
			</p>
			<p>
				Meanwhile, Zia and Franklin continue to tend to Blue in Wu's laboratory.
				Zia reveals to Wu that she had given Blue a transfusion of T. Rex blood,
				infuriating Wu, as it would now be impossible to create an Indoraptor
				with Blue's pure but now apparently T. Rex blood-tainted genome.
				Franklin injects 20 cc's of Carfentanil into Wu's neck, incapacitating
				him, before the two are apprehended by a pair of gunmen. Franklin frees
				Zia from being cuffed to Blue's cage, and Zia frees Blue. As Zia and
				Franklin flee to safety, Blue kills the two gunmen and escapes the
				laboratory before a massive explosion occurs - the brief battle had
				caused damage to several tanks of hydrogen gas within the laboratory.
			</p>
			<p>
				Owen, Claire and Maisie take refuge on the main floor of Lockwood's
				mansion, in the skeleton and replica display room. They notice a human
				corpse on the ground near a Agujaceratops skull; as they approach it,
				the Indoraptor reveals himself and pulls the corpse farther behind the
				skull. The three protagonists take refuge against one of the walls of
				the skull's casing, but the Indoraptor successfully locates their
				vantage point by tracking their scent and climbing on top of the
				Agujaceratops skull. The Indoraptor chases Owen, Claire and Maisie up a
				spiraling staircase before the three escape into a power supply room,
				where Owen turns off the entire mansion's power.
			</p>
			<p>
				Zia and Franklin discover a hydrogen cyanide leak near the laboratory,
				which will kill all of the dinosaurs if it spreads to the encaging area.
				Franklin resets the control system in order to restore power to the
				mansion. At this time, Owen, Claire and Maisie are hiding behind a
				diorama of a Velociraptor and Dilophosaurus engaged in battle near a
				glass wall. Maisie soon realizes that she is staring into the face of
				the Indoraptor through the glass wall and shrieks in terror; the
				Indoraptor breaks the wall and pursues the group once again, injuring
				Claire's leg with his toe claw in the process. The Indoraptor chases
				Maisie up another staircase and down a hallway until Maisie escapes up
				to her bedroom, where she takes refuge in her bed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Owen is urged to take care of Maisie by the injured Claire; the two
				share a passionate kiss before Owen leaves to search for Maisie. The
				Indoraptor, who by this point has ascended to the mansion's roof, lets
				out a demonic screech and descends the building until he reaches the
				windows leading to Maisie's room. Hanging upside down, the Indoraptor
				opens one of the windows and enters Maisie's room, slowly approaching
				her bed as she begins to shiver and cry. Just before the villainous
				hybrid attacks, Owen enters Maisie's bedroom and shoots the Indoraptor
				multiple times with live ammunition. The Indoraptor is unaffected, and
				stands back up to face Owen. Blue enters Maisie's bedroom and confronts
				the Indoraptor; the two begin a vicious fight as Owen and Maisie escape
				the bedroom.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Indoraptor fends off Blue and traps Owen and Maisie on the glass
				roof of the display room. Just before the Indoraptor pounces, Claire
				appears and coaxes him into attacking Owen with the laser and acoustic
				signal on the same gun used in the auction demonstration. The Indoraptor
				charges towards Owen and falls through the glass roof; however, he
				manages to grab ahold of a rafter connecting the glass panes together
				and pulls himself back atop the roof. Blue suddenly appears and jumps
				onto the Indoraptor, causing both to fall down into the display room.
				The Indoraptor falls directly onto the horns of the Agujaceratops skull,
				which impales and kills him, while Blue lands on top of the hybrid's
				corpse and escapes. Franklin and Zia enter and reunite with Owen, Claire
				and Maisie, and the five protagonists escape the battleground.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, a new issue looms; the dinosaurs are trapped in a room that is
				flooded by noxious hydrogen cyanide. Claire releases all of the
				dinosaurs' cages one by one. Claire puts her hand on the red button that
				would release all of them from the entire building, but Owen discourages
				Claire to do so, thus making Claire resist because she does not want the
				dinosaurs to destroy the world. However, Maisie pushes the button
				anyway, releasing the captive dinosaurs, allowing them to escape to the
				mainland, exclaiming, "They're alive, like me."
			</p>
			<p>
				As Mills is about to put the Indominus Rex fragment into the car, a
				stampede sound can be heard. As one of the men goes to investigate, a
				Pteranodon snatches and drops him onto Mills' car, killing him. The now
				free dinosaurs begin to stampede out of the mansion, trampling another
				guard to death. Mills immediately takes refuge under the car, which is
				quickly trampled and destroyed in the stampede. As Mills gets up from
				underneath his wrecked car and tries to pick up the I. Rex fragment, the
				T. Rex suddenly appears and snatches him in her jaws, brutally shredding
				him before tearing him in half with a Carnotaurus, and ultimately
				devouring Mills, the T. Rex then knocks over the Carnotaurus with her
				head scaring it off in the process. The T. Rex triumphantly roars and
				walks away, destroying the I. Rex fragment in the process and ensuring
				that no carnivorous hybrid can ever wreak havoc upon the world again.
				Owen, Claire, Franklin, Zia, and Maisie all exit through the entrance of
				the Lockwood Manor, where Blue reunites with Owen, and even touches
				Owen's hand. Owen instructs for Blue to accompany him; however, Blue
				denies him, as she would rather run free on her own than be kept in a
				cage again.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ian sums up his speech, as a sequence of shots are displayed such as the
				Mosasaurus attacking surfers, the T. Rex roaring at a lion in a zoo,
				Owen, Claire and Maisie are seen driving down the highway to an unknown
				destination, and Blue is shown running and jumping onto a cliff
				overlooking a suburban neighbourhood below, signifying that dinosaurs
				and humans must now co-exist with one another, and calls out four times,
				into the sunset.
			</p>
			<p>
				In a post-credits scene, three Pteranodons fly around and ultimately
				settle down on the Eiffel Tower replica in Las Vegas.
