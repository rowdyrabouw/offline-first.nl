			<h2>Plot Synopsis</h2>
			<p>
				Brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit Jurassic World, a dinosaur theme
				park on Isla Nublar, of which their aunt Claire Dearing is the
				operations manager. Claire assigns her assistant Zara as the boys'
				guide, but they evade her and explore on their own.
			</p>
			<p>
				Elsewhere on the island, former Navy veteran and ethologist Owen Grady
				has been training a quartet of Velociraptors composed of Blue, Delta,
				Echo, and Charlie, and researching their intelligence. Based on the
				raptors' ability to follow commands, head of InGen security Vic Hoskins
				believes that the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his
				assistant Barry vehemently oppose.
			</p>
			<p>
				Prior to its opening, Claire and park owner Simon Masrani inspect the
				park's newest attraction, the Indominus rex, a transgenic dinosaur
				created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu. Masrani tasks Owen with evaluating
				the enclosure's security. Owen warns Claire that the Indominus lacks
				social skills, making it dangerous and unpredictable. When the Indominus
				has apparently escaped, Owen and two park workers enter the enclosure.
				The Indominus, which can camouflage itself and mask its heat signature,
				suddenly appears. Owen survives, but it devours the other two men before
				escaping into the island's interior.
			</p>
			<p>
				Realizing that it is highly vicious and intelligent, Owen advises
				Masrani to have the Indominus destroyed, but to protect his company's
				investment, Masrani dispatches a specialized unit to subdue it with
				non-lethal weaponry, so it can safely be returned to its paddock. After
				most of the unit is slaughtered, Claire orders the evacuation of the
				island's northern sector, while Masrani ponders Owen's warning and
				confronts Wu.
			</p>
			<p>
				While exploring the park in a tour vehicle, Zach and Gray enter a
				restricted area. The Indominus arrives and destroys the vehicle but the
				boys narrowly escape. They find the ruins of the original Jurassic Park
				visitor center, repair an old Jeep Wrangler, and drive back to the park
				resort.
			</p>
			<p>
				As Claire and Owen search for the boys, they barely escape the Indominus
				as well. Masrani and two troopers hunt down the Indominus by helicopter,
				but it breaks into the park's aviary. The aviary's pterosaurs crash
				Masrani's helicopter, killing its passengers, before converging onto the
				resort, and attacking everyone, including Zara who is then devoured by a
				Mosasaurus. Gray and Zach find Owen and Claire at the resort as armed
				personnel shoot down the pterosaurs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Assuming command, Hoskins orders the raptors to be used to track the
				Indominus, where Owen reluctantly complies and spearheads the assault
				with the raptors. Upon finding the Indominus, the dinosaurs begin
				communicating among themselves. Owen realizes that the Indominus has
				Velociraptor DNA and it takes away Owen's command of the raptors,
				becoming the pack's new alpha. Troops fire on the Indominus, but it
				escapes. The raptors kill most of the troops, while Charlie is killed in
				the chaos. Hoskins evacuates Wu and the dinosaur embryos from the island
				to protect Wu's research. Owen, Claire, and the boys find Hoskins at the
				lab securing more embryos, but Delta breaks in and kills him.
			</p>
			<p>
				Owen re-establishes his bond with the three surviving raptors before the
				Indominus reappears. They attack the hybrid, but Delta and Echo are
				killed while Blue is knocked unconscious. Claire releases the
				Tyrannosaurus rex, the park's veteran attraction, from its paddock and
				lures it into a battle with the Indominus. The Indominus quickly gains
				the advantage over the Tyrannosaurus until Blue recovers and joins the
				battle. The duo overpower the Indominus until it gets cornered at the
				lagoon's edge, where it is dragged underwater by the Mosasaurus.
			</p>
			<p>
				The survivors are evacuated and the island is abandoned once again. Zach
				and Gray are reunited with their parents, while Owen and Claire decide
				to stay together. Back on the now-abandoned Isla Nublar, the
				Tyrannosaurus goes up to the helicopter landing pad and roars in
				victory, reestablishing her dominance as Queen of the Island.
