			<h1>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</h1>
			<img src="assets/img/jurassic-park-1997.jpg" alt="" />
			<h2>Plot Synopsis</h2>
			<p>
				The movie opens with an incident on the island of Isla Sorna (code-named
				"Site B" by the InGen company), located in the vicinity of Isla Nublar,
				where the film "Jurassic Park" took place.
			</p>
			<p>
				A British couple has stopped along the coast to relax, and their
				daughter has gone off on her own. She soon encounters a group of
				Compsognathus or "Compies," that attack her, much to the shock of her
				family when they find her after hearing her scream loudly.
			</p>
			<p>
				The film then cuts to Ian Malcolm, who is called to the Mansion of John
				Hammond, the "former" head of InGen. Malcolm meets Hammond's
				grandchildren Lex and Tim there, whom he encountered on Isla Nublar in
				the first film. Malcolm also meets Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow, who
				has taken over InGen as its new Chief Executive Officer. Both trade
				barbs over the aftermath of the incidents at Jurassic Park, with Malcolm
				chastising Ludlow for covering up what really happened, and Ludlow
				claiming Malcolm went public telling stories (of which Malcolm counters
				he told the truth but took no payment for what he revealed).
			</p>
			<p>
				Malcolm then is allowed to visit Hammond, who is now bed-ridden. Malcolm
				is soon shocked when Hammond tells him about Site B. Isla Nublar was the
				location for Jurassic Park, but Site B was where the animals were
				originally created and bred. However, in the aftermath of Hurricane
				Clarissa, Site B was evacuated and the animals let loose to roam free,
				with them inhabiting an environment free of human interference. This
				shocks Malcolm as he had assumed that the dinosaurs should have died,
				since they were bred with a lysine deficiency, that needed to be
				supplied by medical means. Hammond explains he has no idea why they are
				still alive, and shocks Malcolm when he explains that a research team
				has been recruited to conduct studies on this subject, and that brings
				him to Malcolm, who Hammond wants to be the 4th member of the team.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hammond then explains that after the incidents at Jurassic Park, InGen
				has been on the verge of Chapter 11 bankruptcy for some time, with the
				Board wanting to exploit the remaining dinosaurs on Site B for profit
				purposes. Hammond was able to keep them from doing so until the incident
				with the British Family. After this, control of InGen was taken away
				from Hammond, and he explains that his plans for the research team are
				seen as a possible deterrent for whatever his nephew Peter has planned.
			</p>
			<p>
				Malcolm (of course) refuses Hammond's offer, and plans to make sure that
				the research team does not set foot on the island. However, he soon
				finds that his former girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) has
				already arrived, with the additional members to meet her in 3 days.
				Malcolm then leaves planning to rescue Sarah from Site B.
			</p>
			<p>
				Malcolm's next stop is a garage owned by Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff),
				who has been prepping vehicles and equipment for the expedition. Malcolm
				also meets Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughan), who was planning to take video
				and photographic footage for Hammond's expedition. Malcolm is soon after
				joined by his daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester). Kelly wants to come
				along on the expedition, but Malcolm explains she can't go, and the two
				have a small altercation before Malcolm sends her on her way, telling
				her 'not to listen to him.'
			</p>
			<p>
				Malcolm, Eddie and Nick transport two Mercedes SUV's and a modified RV
				to Costa Rica, and then head to Site B. However, the ferryman refuses to
				weight anchor near the islands, claiming that some people wandered too
				close to the island chain and were never heard from again. Through
				translation, Nick explains that the islands are known as Los Cinco
				Muertes ("The Five Deaths").
			</p>
			<p>
				Once on the island, Eddie, Malcolm and Nick locate Sarah using a homing
				beacon on her backpack. They encounter her taking pictures of a herd of
				Stegosaurus, with Sarah seeming to be perfectly fine. Shortly after
				meeting up with her, smoke can be seen from the direction of the RV, and
				the group finds that Kelly has stowed away. This surprise is short-lived
				as suddenly, a fleet of InGen helicopters can be seen flying in vehicles
				and equipment.
			</p>
			<p>
				The team is headed up by Peter Ludlow, and led by Roland Tembo, a
				big-game hunter who is leading the expedition to round up various
				dinosaurs for InGen. After the capture assignment is completed, Roland
				heads off to try and kill a Tyrannosaurus Rex, which he considers his
				fee for the assignment. Roland instead finds an infant Tyrannosaur, and
				has it chained, with the hope that its cries will bring its parents
				back.
			</p>
			<p>
				Meanwhile, Ludlow has arranged a satellite uplink to InGen's boardroom,
				where he is attempting to drum up a sales pitch for InGen's latest plan
				to get itself out of Chapter 11: take John Hammond's dream of a Jurassic
				Park, but build it in a more convenient place. Ludlow tells of his dream
				for Jurassic Park: San Diego, when suddenly, the encampment is attacked
				by the dinosaurs that were caged moments ago (having been freed by Nick
				Van Owen and the others).
			</p>
			<p>
				On his way back to the RV, Nick finds the infant Tyrannosaur, and noting
				that it seems injured, talks Sarah into taking it back to the RV to be
				mended. Once back at the RV, Kelly notes that the Rex is making sounds
				that could attract other animals. Wanting to be somewhere safe, Malcolm
				has Eddie take Kelly into a special perched cage high up in the trees
				some ways off. As they look out over the trees, a familiar sound reaches
				Malcolm's ears, and he then heads back to the RV.
			</p>
			<p>
				Soon after, the Tyrannosaurs come for their infant, and it is returned
				to them. However, they then proceed to push the RV off the nearby
				cliffside. Eddie heads to their rescue and manages to save Malcolm,
				Sarah and Nick, but not before he is eaten by the Rexes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The group soon meets up with Ludlow and Roland's groups, and now have to
				work together to get off the island. The only way to radio for
				communications now is at the main facility in the interior of the
				island. Ludlow warns them that it will be dangerous, because of scans
				having shown that Velociraptors are located in the island interior.
			</p>
			<p>
				The group then sets out for the interior of the island. One evening,
				very close to their destination, the T-Rexes happen to find them. As the
				female chases after one group, Roland attempts to kill the male.
				However, he soon finds that someone has removed the shells from his gun,
				and he instead uses tranquilizers to take down the male.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the confusion, some men scatter into a field of tall-grass, where
				they are taken down by velociraptors hiding in the field. Malcolm,
				Kelly, Sarah and Nick end up making their way to the abandoned main
				facility. While Nick radios for a rescue team, Malcolm, Sarah and Kelly
				end up trying to fend off a group of raptors that have chased them into
				the facility. They manage to escape (along with Nick) when a helicopter
				arrives at the facility. As the helicopter takes off, they see that a
				group has also come for Roland, Peter Ludlow, and some of the remaining
				survivors. The crew has also had a giant cage rigged to transport the
				tranquilized male T-Rex to a waiting ship.
			</p>
			<p>
				Both groups arrive in San Diego, California, where Malcolm and Sarah
				quickly head to InGen's waterfront facility, where Ludlow has arranged a
				last-minute press conference to herald the arrival of the male T-Rex as
				the main attraction for the still-in-construction Jurassic Park: San
				Diego.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, instead of going smoothly, the ship the creature is on crashes
				into the docks. Ludlow, Malcolm, Sarah and some workers go aboard, only
				to find dismembered pieces of the crew, and the cage with the Rex broken
				apart. Suddenly, the doors to the cargo hold burst open, and the male
				T-Rex emerges, making his way off the ship and into the city of San
				Diego.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sarah and Malcolm soon find a surviving crew member who explains that
				after they were in transport of the T-Rex, it stopped breathing, so an
				additional drug was given. However, being unfamiliar with the T-Rex,
				proper dosage was not known. Because of this, the animal is dehydrated.
				Sarah figures that the T-Rex will first find water and then look for
				food. They receive word that Ludlow brought the infant Tyrannosaur as
				well, and transported it in his personal jet to the
				still-in-construction park. The two head there to retrieve it, in hopes
				to use it to lure the T-Rex back to the docks.
			</p>
			<p>
				After recovering the infant, the two find the T-Rex rampaging through
				the city. upon hearing and smelling the infant, the t-Rex follows the
				Malcolm and Sarah back to the docks. Ludlow, upon hearing what has
				happened, orders that the adult male be shot, and that the infant be
				recovered. When he sees Malcolm and Sarah carrying the infant to the
				cargo ship, he quickly follows, only to find the infant in the cargo
				hold. Ludlow attempts to lure the infant out, but soon after, the adult
				male enters the hold, and injures Ludlow, before allowing the infant to
				kill him.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sarah then launches a tranquilizer dart at the T-Rex, which subdues it
				as Malcolm closes the hold's doors. In the aftermath, the Navy and a new
				crew escort the ship back to Isla Sorna, as Malcolm and Sarah rest in
				front of the TV. John Hammond also releases a statement requesting that
				with InGen's secret island of dinosaurs now being realized, that Costa
				Rica help establish the island as a nature preserve, to keep humans from
				setting foot on it.
